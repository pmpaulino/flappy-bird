# 🐦 AI-Assisted Flappy Bird Clone

Hey there! 👋 This is a fun little Flappy Bird clone that @qwertydud3 and I put together during a Sunday afternoon of experimental game development. We wanted to see what it would be like to collaborate with AI tools to create a game from scratch.

## 🤖 AI Collaboration Note
This project was created with significant help from AI tools, including:
- Game code written with assistance from Claude (via Cursor)
- Visual assets generated using AI tools
- Project structure and implementation guidance from AI

This isn't meant to be a serious game development project - it's more of a "vibe coding" session where we explored how AI could help two curious people make something fun together!

## 🎮 The Game
It's a simple Flappy Bird clone with:
- Basic physics
- Score tracking
- High score saving
- Cloud parallax effects
- Clean, minimalist UI

## 🛠️ Running the Game
1. Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed
2. Clone this repo
3. Run `python flappy_bird.py`
4. Press SPACE to flap, ESC to quit
5. Try to beat your high score!

## 📝 Assets
- `bird.png` - Bird sprite (AI-generated)
- `pipe_base.png` - Pipe body texture (AI-generated)
- `pipe_tip.png` - Pipe tip texture (AI-generated)
- `cloud.png` - Cloud sprite (AI-generated)

## 🎨 Just for Fun!
This was a casual experiment in:
- Working with AI coding assistants
- Basic game development concepts
- Having fun with Python and Pygame
- Sunday afternoon bonding 😄

Feel free to play around with it, modify it, or use it as inspiration for your own AI-assisted coding adventures!
